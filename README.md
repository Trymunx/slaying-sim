## Full game coming soon

It'll be here when it's ready, until then use the runGame script to run the version 3 of the game.

### To run:
1. Make the code executable:
`chmod u+x runGame.sh`

2. Then use the following command to run the game:
`./runGame.sh`

Each time you run it, the game output will be saved as text files, which will appear in a folder called output.
